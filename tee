Note: tee reads from standard input and writes the output to both the terminal and one or more files simultaneously.
It is useful for logging, debugging, and capturing command output while still displaying it.
Only basic and commonly useful examples are included here. The command has additional capabilities not covered in this section.

Write command output to a file while displaying it

echo "hello" | tee out.txt

Append output to a file instead of overwriting

echo "log entry" | tee -a log.txt

Save ls output to a file and show it on screen

ls -l | tee files.txt

Pipe through tee to split a pipeline

echo "data" | tee copy.txt | tr 'a-z' 'A-Z'

Capture command output into multiple files

echo "backup" | tee file1.txt file2.txt

Use tee to debug a pipeline

cat input.txt | tee debug.txt | grep "error"

Log system information while viewing it

df -h | tee system-info.txt
