Note: paste merges lines of files horizontally by joining them with a delimiter (default: tab).
It is useful for combining columns, creating simple tables, and aligning data from multiple sources.
Only basic and commonly useful examples are included here. The command has additional capabilities not covered in this section.

Merge two files line by line (default delimiter: tab)

paste file1.txt file2.txt

Use a custom delimiter (comma)

paste -d ',' file1.txt file2.txt

Combine three files into columns

paste file1.txt file2.txt file3.txt

Merge lines from one file with a dash as delimiter

paste -d '-' file.txt file.txt

Combine the output of commands using process substitution

paste <(seq 1 5) <(seq 6 10)

Turn multiple lines into a single tab-separated line

paste -s file.txt

Turn multiple lines into a single comma-separated line

paste -s -d ',' file.txt
