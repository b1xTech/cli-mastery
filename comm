Note: comm compares two sorted files line by line and prints three columns:

Lines only in the first file

Lines only in the second file

Lines common to both files
Only basic and commonly useful examples are included here. The command has additional capabilities not covered in this section.

Show lines unique to file1, unique to file2, and common lines

comm file1.txt file2.txt

Show only lines common to both files

comm -12 file1.txt file2.txt

Show lines unique to file1

comm -23 file1.txt file2.txt

Show lines unique to file2

comm -13 file1.txt file2.txt

Hide column 1 (only show lines from file2 and common lines)

comm -1 file1.txt file2.txt

Compare two sorted lists of users

comm users_old.txt users_new.txt

Use process substitution to avoid creating temporary files
