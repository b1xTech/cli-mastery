Note: printf prints formatted output.
It provides more control and consistency than echo, including formatting numbers, aligning text, and producing structured output.
Only basic and commonly useful examples are included here. The command has additional capabilities not covered in this section.

printf "Hello world\n"

printf "Name: %s, Age: %d\n" "Alice" 30

Print numbers with fixed decimal places

Right-align text using field width

printf "%10s\n" "text"

Left-align text

printf "%-10s\n" "text"

Print a sequence of formatted numbers
