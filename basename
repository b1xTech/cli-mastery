Note: basename strips directory paths from a file path.
It is useful when you need only the filename and not the full path.
Only common usage patterns are included here. Additional options exist but are not covered in this section.

Get filename from a full path

basename /home/user/documents/report.pdf

Remove a file extension

basename report.pdf .pdf

Use inside a loop to process filenames

for f in /var/log/*.log; do
printf "Processing: %s\n" "$(basename "$f")"
done

Extract just the script name inside a Bash script

printf "Script: %s\n" "$(basename "$0")"

Combine with dirname to split path components

file="/opt/data/archive.tar.gz"
printf "Dir: %s, File: %s\n" "$(dirname "$file")" "$(basename "$file")"
