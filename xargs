Note: xargs builds and executes command lines from standard input.
It is commonly used to process lists of items, pass arguments to commands, and handle data streams efficiently.
Only basic and commonly useful examples are included here. The command has additional capabilities not covered in this section.

Run a command for each item in a list

echo "file1 file2 file3" | xargs rm

Pass each line of a file as an argument to a command

cat list.txt | xargs mkdir

Use xargs to count lines in multiple files

ls *.txt | xargs wc -l

Limit how many arguments are passed per command

seq 1 10 | xargs -n 2 echo

Replace placeholder {} with input items

find . -name "*.log" | xargs -I {} mv {} logs/

Read null-separated items (safe for spaces and special chars)

find . -type f -print0 | xargs -0 rm

Use xargs to download URLs from a list

cat urls.txt | xargs -n 1 curl -O
